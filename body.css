//we are each going to have our own CSS files apparently but split up the html

body{
	width: 100%;
}
h1{
	border: 1px solid black;
}

/*NOTES ON CSS //remember tippets has some slides. look on here at the different selectors for sure

cascading style sheets
style language that tells html how to look and how to style
can be written inline for html but dont do this. its a pain in the ass

-selectors.
what are they?
h1{} this is an example of a selector. say we had an h1 element on the page. this selector would apply 
everything to the h1's on the page
div is used for only divs. it is more specific and selects only a select few
# is used for IDs. used for something that appears once or only once on a page. example:
<h1 ID
meant to only be used on one page
span allows you to select a certain area/group area of things i believe. i.e. could span between something with both classes
or two classes
-specificity
class.name is much less specific than div.class-name (not sure on syntax here)
but basically the most specific one will work over the less specific one
dont ever use !important 

----theres a good slide online that shows him programming the css stuff. shows changing font and colors etc
windows and mac will often size fonts in a different manner that is confusing and isnt the same

-positioning. this is generally the hardest part
position. there are some differences and things to use. 
Dispaly is typically only used to hide things
Float and Position are the most important. what we are going to talk about today
margin vs. padding. look on the slides there is a good picture
-floats
float left,right,none
allows things to be wrapped and fit down on the page. i.e. when the element is bigger than the window 
and when youf loat it. just gotta get in and start playing with floats
two divs inside a div. when using floats. it pinches off the original div and there is only two divs bigger 
rather than three
float make things float above the block level elements
to fix float quirks
"clear:both" inside the block level element
float the outer block level elementas well so that both the inner and the outer elements are floated 


-position-
-absolute(this might be the same as fixed) absolute position (something that doesnt scroll or move. it is fixed on the screen)
-fixed allows you to scroll. it is relative to the viewport
-absolute + relative. you position based off of another thing. fixed off of it. you can be in, on , our around something
**again look on his slides at the code that he uses and mess around with it sometime soon**
